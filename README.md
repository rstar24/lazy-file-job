# Instruction 
* Add the python programs in the notebook directory

# Objective 
* I have wasted good amount of time learning system scripting 
* This is good time to put it to some real good work
* So, Here I am making a simpel bash script that is going to make all the python file assingment for me and my friends.

# Let me be clear 
* I am not going to make this script portable at all so clone at your own risk.

# Dependencies
* Latex, awk, sed 
* Maybe more of them.
